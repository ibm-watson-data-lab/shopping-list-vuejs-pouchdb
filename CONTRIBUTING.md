## Contributing In General

Our project welcomes external contributions! If you have an itch, please
feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, you can submit a pull request.  A 
good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the issue tracker. Before embarking on
a more ambitious contribution, please raise an issue for discussion.

**We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in the queue for a long time,
or cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please raise an issue before sending a pull
request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid you spending your
valuable time working on a feature that the project developers are not willing
or able to accept into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please raise an issue before sending a pull
request so it can be discussed. If the fix is trivial or non controversial then
this is not usually necessary.

### Merge approval

Two project maintainers will need to review and approve your pull request before it
is merged.  They may request changes or ask questions so keep an eye on your pull
request while review is in progress.  Maintainers will expect that:

 - tests pass, and new features have accompanying tests (see the project `README` for more information about running tests)
 - documentation has been updated where appropriate
 - any coding standards have been followed (see the project `README` for more information about coding standards)

Some or all of these checks may be automated so look out for immediate feedback from the
CI system on your pull request.

For more details, see the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Developer Setup

Follow the "Run locally" steps in the `README` and you will have a local git repo 
and test environment, or use "Deploy to IBM Cloud" and you can use the IBM Cloud DevOps environment.
